# Effective-happiness
This object returns random data from a database, based on certain parameters that you give it.

# How to use?
 You must set up a database in config/ini/config.php.ini

 ### Example
 ```bash
$foo = new IdRand(tableName, ColName);
```
 ```bash
$foo = idRand();
```
```bash
echo $foo;
```
```bash
result $randomString
```
#### This is my first object worked on in PHP, I welcome suggestions.
